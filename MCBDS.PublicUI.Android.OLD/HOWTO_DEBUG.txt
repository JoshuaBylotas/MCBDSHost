# How to Debug MCBDS.PublicUI.Android

## The Issue You're Facing

```
The target process exited without raising a CoreCLR started event.
```

**This means**: App is crashing on the Android device before Visual Studio debugger can attach.

**Solution**: Use Android Logcat (not Visual Studio debugger) to see error messages.

## How to Fix It

### 1. Setup Complete?
```bash
python MCBDS.PublicUI.Android/setup-links.py
```

### 2. Open Android Device Monitor
- Android Studio ? Device Manager ? Select your emulator/device ? View Logs

### 3. Build & Run
```bash
dotnet run MCBDS.PublicUI.Android -f net10.0-android
```

### 4. Read Logcat
Watch for messages like:
```
? HttpClient registered
? ServerConfigService registered
? BedrockApiService registered
? Blazor WebView registered
? MAUI app built successfully
```

If you see `?` message, that's where it's failing.
