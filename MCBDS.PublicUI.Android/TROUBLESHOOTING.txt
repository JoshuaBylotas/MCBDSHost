=== Android Connection Troubleshooting - WINSERVER03.bylotas.net ===

ISSUE: Android app cannot connect to http://WINSERVER03.bylotas.net:8081

CHANGES MADE:
1. Updated network_security_config.xml - Added explicit winserver03.bylotas.net
2. Updated MauiProgram.cs - Increased timeout to 60s, added logging
3. Created ConnectionTest.razor - Diagnostic tool

QUICK DIAGNOSTIC STEPS:

Step 1: Test in Android Chrome Browser
- Open Chrome on your Android device
- Navigate to: http://winserver03.bylotas.net:8081/health
- Does it work? 
  YES ? App configuration issue
  NO ? Network/Server issue

Step 2: Test in PC Browser
- Open Chrome on your PC
- Navigate to: http://winserver03.bylotas.net:8081/health
- Does it work?
  YES ? Android network issue
  NO ? Server configuration issue

Step 3: Check Server Listening
- On WINSERVER03, run: netstat -an | findstr 8081
- Should show: 0.0.0.0:8081 (all interfaces)
- If shows: 127.0.0.1:8081 (localhost only - PROBLEM!)

Step 4: Clean Rebuild App
- Uninstall app from Android device completely
- Clean solution in Visual Studio
- Rebuild MCBDS.PublicUI.Android
- Reinstall on device
- Try again

COMMON URL FORMATS TO TRY:
1. http://winserver03.bylotas.net:8081 (lowercase)
2. http://WINSERVER03.bylotas.net:8081 (uppercase)
3. http://[SERVER-IP-ADDRESS]:8081 (direct IP)

CHECK THESE:
[ ] Can access from PC browser?
[ ] Can access from Android Chrome?
[ ] Server listening on 0.0.0.0:8081?
[ ] Firewall allows port 8081?
[ ] Android on same network as server?
[ ] App rebuilt after code changes?
[ ] App uninstalled/reinstalled?

LOGCAT COMMAND:
adb logcat | findstr "http network connection error"

FILES MODIFIED:
- Platforms\Android\Resources\xml\network_security_config.xml
- MauiProgram.cs
- Components\ConnectionTest.razor (NEW)

BUILD STATUS: SUCCESSFUL
NEXT: Deploy to Android and test
