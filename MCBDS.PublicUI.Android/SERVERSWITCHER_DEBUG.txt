=== ServerSwitcher Not Working - Diagnostics Added ===

ISSUE: ServerSwitcher appears but doesn't work/respond

CHANGES MADE:
1. Added debug logging throughout ServerSwitcher component
2. Added error handling with try-catch blocks
3. Added "Loading..." message when servers list is empty
4. Added user-friendly error messages
5. Fixed potential null reference issues

DEBUG OUTPUT TO CHECK:
The component now logs to Debug console:
- "ServerSwitcher: OnInitializedAsync started"
- "ServerSwitcher: Loaded X servers"
- "ServerSwitcher: LoadServers complete. Current URL: ..."
- "ServerSwitcher: OnServerSelected - value: ..."
- "ServerSwitcher: Adding new server - Name: X, URL: Y"
- "ServerSwitcher: Normalized URL: ..."

ERROR MESSAGES NOW SHOWN:
- "Error loading servers" - if LoadServers fails
- "Error saving server" - if SaveEditedServer fails
- "Name and URL required" - if adding without both fields
- "Error switching server" - if OnServerSelected fails
- "Failed to add server" - if AddServerAsync returns false

HOW TO USE (TESTING):
1. Deploy the updated app to Android device/emulator
2. Look at Debug output window in Visual Studio
3. Check for ServerSwitcher log messages
4. Try to interact with ServerSwitcher:
   - Click dropdown
   - Select "+ Add New Server..."
   - Enter name and URL
   - Click checkmark

WHAT TO CHECK:
[ ] Does dropdown show "Loading..." initially?
[ ] Does dropdown populate with servers?
[ ] Can you click the dropdown?
[ ] Can you select "+ Add New Server..."?
[ ] Do input fields appear?
[ ] Can you type in the fields?
[ ] Does checkmark button work?

COMMON ISSUES:

1. **Dropdown not responding**
   - Check if touch events are being blocked
   - Look for JavaScript errors in debug console

2. **Input fields not appearing**
   - Check debug output for "OnServerSelected" message
   - Verify isEditing is being set to true

3. **Save button not working**
   - Check debug output for "Adding new server" message
   - Look for error messages

4. **No servers showing**
   - Check debug output for "Loaded X servers"
   - Verify server-config.json exists in AppDataDirectory

TO VIEW DEBUG OUTPUT:
1. Visual Studio ? View ? Output
2. Select "Debug" from dropdown
3. Look for lines starting with "ServerSwitcher:"

FILE MODIFIED:
- MCBDS.PublicUI.Android\Components\ServerSwitcher.razor

BUILD STATUS: ? SUCCESSFUL

NEXT STEPS:
1. Stop current debug session
2. Clean and rebuild
3. Deploy to device/emulator
4. Check Debug output window
5. Try interacting with ServerSwitcher
6. Report what debug messages you see
