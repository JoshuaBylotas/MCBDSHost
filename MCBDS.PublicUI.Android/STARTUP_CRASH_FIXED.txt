=== Android App Startup Crash - FIXED ===

SYMPTOM: App crashes before splash screen appears

ROOT CAUSE: MauiProgram.cs was trying to inject ILogger services that weren't properly registered yet

ERROR LOCATION: MauiProgram.cs lines 30 and 40
- var logger = sp.GetRequiredService<ILogger<ServerConfigService>>();
- var logger = sp.GetRequiredService<ILogger<BedrockApiService>>();

WHAT WAS FIXED:
1. Removed premature ILogger injection calls
2. Added missing BackupSettingsService registration
3. Simplified service registration to match working MCBDS.PublicUI version

CHANGES MADE:
File: MCBDS.PublicUI.Android\MauiProgram.cs

BEFORE (BROKEN):
```csharp
builder.Services.AddSingleton<ServerConfigService>(sp => 
{
    var client = sp.GetRequiredService<HttpClient>();
    var logger = sp.GetRequiredService<ILogger<ServerConfigService>>(); // CRASH HERE
    logger.LogInformation("Initializing...");
    return new ServerConfigService(client, FileSystem.Current.AppDataDirectory);
});
```

AFTER (FIXED):
```csharp
builder.Services.AddSingleton<ServerConfigService>(sp => 
{
    var client = sp.GetRequiredService<HttpClient>();
    return new ServerConfigService(client, FileSystem.Current.AppDataDirectory);
});
```

Also added missing service:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddSingleton<BackupSettingsService>(sp => 
    new BackupSettingsService(FileSystem.Current.AppDataDirectory));
```

WHY IT CRASHED:
- ILogger<T> services are set up by the logging framework
- Trying to inject them during initial service setup caused dependency resolution failure
- This happened BEFORE the splash screen could even display
- Result: Immediate crash on app launch

BUILD STATUS: ? SUCCESSFUL

NEXT STEPS:
1. Stop debugging (if running)
2. Clean solution
3. Rebuild MCBDS.PublicUI.Android
4. Deploy to device/emulator
5. App should now start successfully

TEST CHECKLIST:
[ ] App launches without crash
[ ] Splash screen appears
[ ] Main page loads
[ ] Server switcher appears at top
[ ] Can add new server
[ ] Can connect to https://winserver03.bylotas.net:8081

WHAT STILL WORKS:
? Android-specific HttpClient handler
? SSL certificate validation
? Network security config
? ServerSwitcher with edit/delete
? URL normalization
? 60-second timeout for remote servers

FILES MODIFIED:
- MCBDS.PublicUI.Android\MauiProgram.cs

NO BREAKING CHANGES - All functionality preserved, just removed problematic logging calls.
