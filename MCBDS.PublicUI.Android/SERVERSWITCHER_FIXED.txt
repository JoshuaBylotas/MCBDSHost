=== Android ServerSwitcher - FIXED ===

WHAT WAS WRONG:
1. Missing edit functionality - couldn't edit existing servers
2. Missing delete functionality - couldn't remove servers
3. Didn't use NormalizeUrl - URL typos like "hpps://" weren't fixed
4. Missing IDisposable - potential memory leaks

WHAT WAS FIXED:
1. Added EDIT button - click pencil icon to edit server name/URL
2. Added DELETE button - click trash icon to remove servers
3. Added NormalizeUrl helper - automatically fixes URL typos
4. Added IDisposable - proper cleanup

1. Click dropdown ? "+ Add New Server..."

IMPORTANT: For Your Server

- The HTTPS version works in Chrome, so use that!

- "hpps://" ? "https://"
- "htps://" ? "https://"
- "hhtp://" ? "http://"
